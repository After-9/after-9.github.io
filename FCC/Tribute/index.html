  Edith Garrud was a British suffragette, playwright and the first female martial arts instructor in the western world. She was trained in Jujitsu under Edward Barton Wright the first man to bring Jujitsu to Britain. Garrud taught Jujitsu to other suffragettes to defend against the common police harassment. To quote scholar Diana Looser <blockquote>Edith Garrud's importance lies in her appreciation and deployment of the broader political potential encoded in jujutsu skills. In adopting jujutsu as a radical physical and political performance that disrupted simultaneously gender expectations and the masculine ideal upon which the discourse of British nationalism was based, Garrud helped modify women's cultural identities while resignifying the Japanese martial arts in terms of social purpose and gender, class and national identity. In this era of sought-after personal and political autonomy, Garrud's use of the martial arts reflected, and helped contribute to, social change.</blockquote>
